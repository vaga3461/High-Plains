    "The model contained in this notebook is a 1D river profile evolution model across multiple lithologies. Without being specific to actual rock type, the lithologies represented in this model will simply be referred to as \"hard\" and \"soft\" (though it should be noted that some values used in this model are experimental data from granites and sandstones, respectively). This model is applicable anywhere that rivers traverse multiple bedrock types, but was developed for the specific case of erosion in a sedimentary basin adjacent to a crystalline mountain range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we represent only two lithologies, but the code to set up the bedrock divisions could easily be altered to include more units. However, doing so should require careful thought about how each unit contributes (or not) to coarse bedload material in transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic functions of this model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Erode bedrock via both plucking and abrasion\n",
    "- Generate coarse sediment through plucking of resistant lithology\n",
    "- Allow sediment fining downstream via grain attrition\n",
    "- Modulate bedrock erosion rates based on amount of aslluvial bed cover present\n",
    "\n",
    "This resource will be updated with more figures, examples, animations, annotations, and other code improvements in the near future. This is just a first contribution ahead of AGU 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planned updates:\n",
    "- Add plotting and animnation to fuction (<i>Purpose: automatically generate animation everytime function is run, and easily capture outputs from different timesteps without having to re-run function</i>)\n",
    "- Write `q` as an integral-style sum (<i> Purpose: honor that upstream increases in runoff also affect downstream discharge, even if downstream runoff does not increase </i>)\n",
    "- Add more annotations within function (<i>Purpose: additional explanation for new user</i>)\n",
    "- Try to write loop part of function <i>outside</i> of function first, then call it within the function (<i>Purpose: streamline code, make it easier to read with less scrolling necessary to see full function</i>\n",
