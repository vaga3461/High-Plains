	abstract = {Abstract. Alluvial and transport-limited bedrock rivers constitute the majority of fluvial systems on Earth. Their long profiles hold clues to their present state and past evolution. We currently possess first-principles-based governing equations for flow, sediment transport, and channel morphodynamics in these systems, which we lack for detachment-limited bedrock rivers. Here we formally couple these equations for transport-limited gravel-bed river long-profile evolution. The result is a new predictive relationship whose functional form and parameters are grounded in theory and defined through experimental data. From this, we produce a power-law analytical solution and a finite-difference numerical solution to long-profile evolution. Steady-state channel concavity and steepness are diagnostic of external drivers: concavity decreases with increasing uplift rate, and steepness increases with an increasing sediment-to-water supply ratio. Constraining free parameters explains common observations of river form: to match observed channel concavities, gravel-sized sediments must weather and fine – typically rapidly – and valleys typically should widen gradually. To match the empirical square-root width–discharge scaling in equilibrium-width gravel-bed rivers, downstream fining must occur. The ability to assign a cause to such observations is the direct result of a deductive approach to developing equations for landscape evolution.},

            In most landscape evolution models, extreme rainfall enhances river incision. In steep landscapes, however, these events trigger landslides that can buffer incision via increased sediment delivery and aggradation. We quantify landslide sediment aggradation and erosional buffering with a natural experiment in southern Taiwan where a northward gradient in tectonic activity drives increasing landscape steepness. We find that landscape response to extreme rainfall during the 2009 typhoon Morakot varied along this gradient, where steep areas experienced widespread channel sediment aggradation of \&gt;10 m and less steep areas did not noticeably aggrade. We model sediment export to estimate a sediment removal timeline and find that steep, tectonically active areas with the most aggradation may take centuries to resume bedrock incision. Expected sediment cover duration reflects tectonic uplift. We find that despite high stream power, sediment cover may keep steep channels from eroding bedrock for up to half of a given time period. This work highlights the importance of dynamic sediment cover in landscape evolution and suggests a mechanism by which erosional efficiency in tectonically active landscapes may decrease as landscape steepness increases.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The 1-D saltation–abrasion model of channel bedrock incision of Sklar and Dietrich (2004), in which the erosion rate is buffered by the surface area fraction of bedrock covered by alluvium, was a major advance over models that treat river erosion as a function of bed slope and drainage area. Their model is, however, limited because it calculates bed cover in terms of bedload sediment supply rather than local bedload transport. It implicitly assumes that as sediment supply from upstream changes, the transport rate adjusts instantaneously everywhere downstream to match. This assumption is not valid in general, and thus can give rise to unphysical consequences. Here we present a unified morphodynamic formulation of both channel incision and alluviation that specifically tracks the spatiotemporal variation in both bedload transport and alluvial thickness. It does so by relating the bedrock cover fraction to the ratio of alluvium thickness to bedrock macro-roughness, rather than to the ratio of bedload supply rate to capacity bedload transport. The new formulation (MRSAA) predicts waves of alluviation and rarification, in addition to bedrock erosion. Embedded in it are three physical processes: alluvial diffusion, fast downstream advection of alluvial disturbances, and slow upstream migration of incisional disturbances. Solutions of this formulation over a fixed bed are used to demonstrate the stripping of an initial alluvial cover, the emplacement of alluvial cover over an initially bare bed and the advection–diffusion of a sediment pulse over an alluvial bed. A solution for alluvial–incisional interaction in a channel with a basement undergoing net rock uplift shows how an impulsive increase in sediment supply can quickly and completely bury the bedrock under thick alluvium, thus blocking bedrock erosion. As the river responds to rock uplift or base level fall, the transition point separating an alluvial reach upstream from an alluvial–bedrock reach downstream migrates upstream in the form of a "hidden knickpoint". A tectonically more complex case of rock uplift subject to a localized zone of subsidence (graben) yields a steady-state solution that is not attainable with the original saltation–abrasion model. A solution for the case of bedrock–alluvial coevolution upstream of an alluviated river mouth illustrates how the bedrock surface can be progressively buried not far below the alluvium. Because the model tracks the spatiotemporal variation in both bedload transport and alluvial thickness, it is applicable to the study of the incisional response of a river subject to temporally varying sediment supply. It thus has the potential to capture the response of an alluvial–bedrock river to massive impulsive sediment inputs associated with landslides or debris flows.},

These stops were chosen to emphasize recent work that supports multiple phases of extension in the region, and is recorded by the interactions of complexly overprinted normal faults. Mapping of the Ibex Hills revealed an older set of normal faults that have a down-to-the-SW sense of movement and are cross-cut by down-to-the-NW style normal faults. Additionally, the Ibex Pass basin poses a number of questions regarding its stratigraphy and how it relates to the timing and kinematics of the region. Multiple stops within the basin will show the variation of volcanic and sedimentary units across Ibex Pass. The second day of the field trip is focused more so on the more recent transtensional and strike-slip history of southern Death Valley. In particular, recent mapping has correlated features in the Avawatz and Owlshead Mountains that indicate {\textasciitilde}40k m of offset along the Southern Death Valley Fault Zone (SDVFZ). Stops will take place along traces of the SDVFZ in the Avawatz Mountains and the Noble Hills. The final stop of the trip is in the Mormon Point turtleback, where the implications of the SDVFZ offset are discussed, alongside the metamorphic rocks at the stop, suggesting the restoration of the Panamint Range partially atop the Black Mountains.},

	title = {River incision into bedrock: {Mechanics} and relative efficacy of plucking, abrasion, and cavitation},
	abstract = {Improved formulation of bedrock erosion laws requires knowledge of the actual processes operative at the bed. We present qualitative field evidence from a wide range of settings that the relative efficacy of the various processes of fluvial erosion (e.g., plucking, abrasion, cavitation, solution) is a strong function of substrate lithology, and that joint spacing, fractures, and bedding planes exert the most direct control. The relative importance of the various processes and the nature of the interplay between them are inferred from detailed observations of the morphology of erosional forms on channel bed and banks, and their spatial distributions. We find that plucking dominates wherever rocks are well jointed on a submeter scale. Hydraulic wedging of small clasts into cracks, bashing and abrasion by bedload, and chemical and physical weathering all contribute to the loosening and removal of joint blocks. In more massive rocks, abrasion by suspended sand appears to be rate limiting in the systems studied here. Concentration of erosion on downstream sides of obstacles and tight coupling between fluid-flow patterns and fine-scale morphology of erosion forms testify to the importance of abrasion by suspended-load, rather than bedload, particles. Mechanical analyses indicate that erosion by suspendedload abrasion is considerably more nonlinear in shear stress than erosion by plucking. In addition, a new analysis indicates that cavitation is more likely to occur in natural systems than previously argued. Cavitation must be considered a viable process in many actively incising bedrock channels and may contribute to the fluting and potholing of massive, unjointed rocks that is otherwise attributed to suspended-load abrasion. Direct field evidence of cavitation erosion is, however, lacking. In terms of the well-known shear-stress (or stream-power) erosion law, erosion by plucking is consistent with a slope exponent (n) of {\textasciitilde}2/3 to 1, whereas erosion by suspended-load abrasion is more consistent with a slope exponent of {\textasciitilde}5/3. Given that substrate lithology appears to dictate the dominant erosion process, this finding has important implications for longterm landscape evolution and the models used to study it.},

Of these, some can be rejected on the basis of unrealistic morphology and slope-area scaling. An expression is derived for total drainage basin relief and its apportionment between hillslope and fluvial components. Relief and valley density are found to vary with tectonic forcing in a manner that reflects erosion physics; these properties therefore constitute an additional set of testable predictions. Finally, transient responses to tectonic perturbations are shown to depend strongly on the degree of nonlinearity in the incision process.

We compare several small channels that share tributary junctions and have incised into the same sedimentary bedrock unit (Navajo Sandstone) but contain differing amounts of coarse diorite clasts owing to the spatial distribution of localized sediment sources. Bedrock channels that contain abundant clasts (diorite-rich) have steeper longitudinal slopes than tributaries of these channels with smaller drainage areas and less sediment (diorite-poor). The diorite-poor tributaries have incised more deeply to lower average slopes and have more reach-scale slope variability, which may reflect bedrock properties, longitudinal sediment sorting, and incision at lower sediment supply. Diorite-rich channels have less bedrock exposed and smoother longitudinal profiles than diorite-poor channels. We find that (1) coarse sediment can mantle bedrock channel beds and reduce the efficiency of incision, validating the hypothesized cover effect in fluvial incision models; (2) the channel slope needed to transport the sediment load can be larger than that needed to erode bedrock, suggesting that the slope of incising bedrock channels can become adjusted to the sediment load; (3) when abundant sediment is available, transport capacity rather than thresholds of motion can be dominant in setting bedrock channel slope; and (4) cover effects can be important even when moderate amounts of bedrock are exposed in channel beds.},

	abstract = {The incision rate and steepness of bedrock channels depend on water discharge, uplift rate, substrate lithology, sediment flux, and bedload size. However, the relative role of these factors and the sensitivity of channel steepness to rapid ({\textgreater}1 mm yr−1) uplift rates remain unclear. We conducted field and topographic analyses of fluvial bedrock channels with varying channel bed lithology and sediment source rock along the Coastal Range in eastern Taiwan, where uplift rates vary from 1.8 to 11.8 mm yr−1 and precipitation is relatively consistent (1.5–2.7 m yr−1), to evaluate the controls on bedrock channel steepness. We find that channel steepness is independent of rock uplift rate and annual precipitation but increases monotonically with sediment size and substrate strength. Furthermore, in reaches with uniform substrate lithology (mudstone and flysch), channel steepness systematically varies with sediment source rock but not with channel width. When applied to our data, a mechanistic incision model (saltation-abrasion model) suggests that the steepness of Coastal Range channels is set primarily by coarse-sediment supply. We also observe that larger particles are mainly composed of resistant lithologies derived from volcanic rocks and conglomerates. This result implies that hillslope bedrock properties in the source area exert a dominant control on the steepness of proximal channels through coarse-sediment production in this setting. We propose that channel steepness may be insensitive to uplift rate and flow discharge in fast-uplifting landscapes where incision processes are set by coarse sediment size and supply. Models assuming a proportionality between incision rate and basal shear stress (stream power) may not fully capture controls on fluvial channel profiles in landslide-dominated landscapes. Processes other than channel steepening, such as enhanced bedload impacts and debris-flow scour, may be required to balance rock uplift and incision in these transport-limited systems.},

            Large floods should seemingly influence the depth and width of rivers. Phillips and Jerolmack, however, suggest that the self-organization of bedrock river channels blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events. River channel geometries from a wide range of course-grained rivers across the United States show that larger floods have very limited additional impact on channel geometry. River channel sculpting does increase as flood size increases, but the effect is most pronounced for moderate floods. This relationship may explain the long-term stability of rivers across shifts in climate.

            Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are hypothesized to influence landscape evolution through erosion and sediment transport by rivers. However, determining the relation between rainfall and river dynamics requires a greater understanding of the feedbacks between flooding and a river’s capacity to transport sediment. We analyzed channel geometry and stream-flow records from 186 coarse-grained rivers across the United States. We found that channels adjust their shape so that floods slightly exceed the critical shear velocity needed to transport bed sediment, independently of climatic, tectonic, and bedrock controls. The distribution of fluid shear velocity associated with floods is universal, indicating that self-organization of near-critical channels filters the climate signal evident in discharge. This effect blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events on landscape evolution.},

            Geomorphologists commonly assume that gravel-bedded rivers tend toward a “threshold” equilibrium state, in which the median-sized grains on the riverbed surface begin to move at the bankfull flood stage. However, here we show that this widely held assumption fails to capture a more fundamental pattern in river channel geometry. Our findings provide evidence that river channel geometry and grain size are inherently linked to the supply of sediment transported from upstream. Threshold channels may therefore simply reflect settings with low sediment supplies, while high sediment supply channels are adjusted to transport large volumes of material during bankfull floods. Thus, an understanding of sediment supply is key to interpreting, predicting, and restoring bankfull geometry in rivers.
          , 
            
              In many gravel-bedded rivers, floods that fill the channel banks create just enough shear stress to move the median-sized gravel particles on the bed surface (

              has become a commonly used assumption. However, not all natural gravel channels actually conform to this simple relationship; some channels maintain bankfull stresses far in excess of the critical stress required to initiate sediment transport.

We currently possess first-principles-based governing equations for flow, sediment transport, and channel morphodynamics in these systems, which we lack for detachment-limited bedrock rivers. Here we formally couple these equations for transport-limited gravel-bed river long-profile evolution. The result is a new predictive relationship whose functional form and parameters are grounded in theory and defined through experimental data. From this, we produce a power-law analytical solution and a finite-difference numerical solution to long-profile evolution. Steady-state channel concavity and steepness are diagnostic of external drivers: concavity decreases with increasing uplift rate, and steepness increases with an increasing sediment-to-water supply ratio. Constraining free parameters explains common observations of river form: to match observed channel concavities, gravel-sized sediments must weather and fine – typically rapidly – and valleys typically should widen gradually. To match the empirical square-root width–discharge scaling in equilibrium-width gravel-bed rivers, downstream fining must occur. The ability to assign a cause to such observations is the direct result of a deductive approach to developing equations for landscape evolution.},

Here we present a testable framework for the study of fluvial incision into bedrock that combines theory with field observation. We quantify a simple erosion law by measuring drainage areas and slopes on both principal channels and tributaries. The data suggest that both a bedrock tributary and main stem will lower at the same rate at their confluence if the ratio of main stem to tributary drainage area equals the ratio of tributary to main stem channel slope at the junction. Erosion across several tributary junctions is therefore linearly related to stream power. Tributary slopes greater than about 0.2 deviate from this linear prediction, apparentiy because debris flows scour these steep tributaries. Further field study suggests that the common elevation of tributary and main stem may result from the upslope propagation of locally steep reaches generated at tributary mouths. This propagation continues only to the point on the channel where the channel slope is too steep to preserve the oversteepened reach, or knickpoint, and debris flow scour dominates channel erosion.},

	abstract = {The stream power incision model (SPIM) is a cornerstone of quantitative geomorphology. It states that river incision rate is the product of drainage area and channel slope raised to the power exponents m and n, respectively. It is widely used to predict patterns of deformation from channel long profile inversion or to model knickpoint migration and landscape evolution. Numerous studies have attempted to test its applicability with mixed results prompting the question of its validity. This paper synthesizes these results, highlights the SPIM deficiencies, and offers new insights into the role of incision thresholds and channel width. By reviewing quantitative data on incising rivers, I first propose six sets of field evidence that any long-term incision model should be able to predict. This analysis highlights several inconsistencies of the standard SPIM. Next, I discuss the methods used to construct physics-based long-term incision laws. I demonstrate that all published incising river datasets away from knickpoints or knickzones are in a regime dominated by threshold effects requiring an explicit upscaling of flood stochasticity neglected in the standard SPIM and other incision models. Using threshold-stochastic simulations with dynamic width, I document the existence of composite transient dynamics where knickpoint propagation locally obeys a linear SPIM (n=1) while other part of the river obey a non-linear SPIM (n{\textgreater}1). The threshold-stochastic SPIM resolves some inconsistencies of the standard SPIM and matches steady-state field evidence when width is not sensitive to incision rate. However it fails to predict the scaling of slope with incision rate for cases where width decreases with incision rate. Recent proposed models of dynamic width cannot resolve these deficiencies. An explicit upscaling of sediment flux and threshold-stochastic effects combined with dynamic width should take us beyond the SPIM which is shown here to have a narrow range of validity.

Unit stream powers are {\textasciitilde}4 times higher than those predicted by current scaling paradigms and imply that incision rates for rivers responding to active tectonics may be signiﬁcantly higher than those heretofore modeled. The loss of hydraulic scaling cannot be explained by increasing channel roughness and is an intrinsic response to tectonic forcing. We show that channel aspect ratio is a strongly nonlinear function of local slope and demonstrate that fault-induced adjustment of channel geometries has reset hillslope gradients. The results give new insight into how rivers maintain their course in the face of tectonic uplift and illustrate the ﬁrst-order control the ﬂuvial system exerts on the locus and magnitude of sediment supply to basins.},

	abstract = {The pattern of fluvial incision across the Himalayas of central Nepal is estimated from the distribution of Holocene and Pleistocene terraces and from the geometry of modern channels along major rivers draining across the range. The terraces provide good constraints on incision rates across the Himalayan frontal folds (Sub-Himalaya or Siwaliks Hills) where rivers are forced to cut down into rising anticlines and have abandoned numerous strath terraces. Farther north and upstream, in the Lesser Himalaya, prominent fill terraces were deposited, probably during the late Pleistocene, and were subsequently incised. The amount of bedrock incision beneath the fill deposits is generally small, suggesting a slow rate of fluvial incision in the Lesser Himalaya. The terrace record is lost in the high range where the rivers are cutting steep gorges. To complement the terrace study, fluvial incision was also estimated from the modern channel geometries using an estimate of the shear stress exerted by the flowing water at the bottom of the channel as a proxy for river incision rate. This approach allows quantification of the effect of variations in channel slope, width, and discharge on the incision rate of a river; the determination of incision rates requires an additional lithological calibration. The two approaches are shown to yield consistent results when applied to the same reach or if incision profiles along nearby parallel reaches are compared. In the Sub-Himalaya, river incision is rapid, with values up to 10–15 mm/yr. It does not exceed a few millimeters per year in the Lesser Himalaya, and rises abruptly at the front of the high range to reach values of ∼4–8 mm/yr within a 50-km-wide zone that coincides with the position of the highest Himalayan peaks. Sediment yield derived from the measurement of suspended load in Himalayan rivers suggests that fluvial incision drives hillslope denudation of the landscape at the scale of the whole range. The observed pattern of erosion is found to closely mimic uplift as predicted by a mechanical model taking into account erosion and slip along the flat-ramp-flat geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault. The morphology of the range reflects a dynamic equilibrium between present-day tectonics and surface processes. The sharp relief together with the high uplift rates in the Higher Himalaya reflects thrusting over the midcrustal ramp rather than the isostatic response to reincision of the Tibetan Plateau driven by late Cenozoic climate change, or late Miocene reactivation of the Main Central Thrust.},

	abstract = {River morphology and dynamics are strongly inﬂuenced by active tectonics. We report channel dynamics for the Peikang River, which ﬂows through the Hsuehshan Range in central Taiwan. Using a digital elevation model and ﬁeld surveys, we constrain channel morphology for an {\textasciitilde}90 km stretch of river to calculate unit stream power and boundary shear stress along the river path. Incision rates are estimated with optically stimulated luminescence dating of sand deposited on strath terraces. We ﬁnd a strong correlation between unit stream power/ shear stress and incision rate, but only if variation in channel width is considered. A calibrated river incision rule implies river incision rates of {\textasciitilde}9–13.5 mm/yr upstream of the Meiyuan and Tili faults and suggests that one or both of these structures are presently active. Our results indicate that the Shuilikeng fault is also actively deforming, as incision rates increase to {\textasciitilde}6–10 mm/yr across it, compared to 1–4 mm/yr in adjacent reaches. Prominent narrowing across the Shuilikeng fault, and the absence of signiﬁcant gradient variation indicate that channel width is a ﬁrst-order morphological adjustment to differential incision. Only when the channel width-to-depth ratio reaches a minimum does the channel slope signiﬁcantly adjust to local changes in base level, as is the case upstream of the Meiyuan and Tili faults.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical investigations suggest that the rate of river incision into bedrock depends nonlinearly on sediment supply, challenging the common assumption that incision rate is simply proportional to stream power. Our measurements from laboratory abrasion mills support the hypothesis that sediment promotes erosion at low supply rates by providing tools for abrasion, but inhibits erosion at high supply rates by burying underlying bedrock beneath transient deposits. Maximum erosion rates occur at a critical level of coarse-grained sediment supply where the bedrock is only partially exposed. Fine-grained sediments provide poor abrasive tools for lowering bedrock river beds because they tend to travel in suspension. Experiments also reveal that rock resistance to ﬂuvial erosion scales with the square of rock tensile strength. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variations in the extent of bedrock exposure provide incising rivers with a previously unrecognized degree of freedom in adjusting to changes in rock uplift rate and climate. Furthermore, we conclude that the grain size distribution of sediment supplied by hillslopes to the channel network is a fundamental control on bedrock channel gradients and topographic relief.},

	abstract = {Methods for identifying the size, or scale, of hillslopes and the extent of channel networks from digital elevation models (DEMs) are examined critically. We show that a constant critical support area, the method most commonly used at present for channel network extraction from DEMs, is more appropriate for depicting the hillslope/valley transition than for identifying channel heads. Analysis of high-resolution DEMs confirms that a constant contributing area per unit contour length defines the extent of divergent topography, or the hillslope scale, although there is considerable variance about the average value. In even moderately steep topography, however, a DEM resolution finer than the typical 30 m by 30 m grid size is required to accurately resolve the hillslope/valley transition. For many soil-mantled landscapes, a slope-dependent critical support area is both theoretically and empirically more appropriate for defining the extent of channel networks. Implementing this method for overland flow erosion requires knowledge of an appropriate proportionality constant for the drainage area-slope threshold controlling channel initiation. Several methods for estimating this constant from DEM data are examined, but acquisition of even limited field data is recommended. Finally, the hypothesis is proposed that an inflection in the drainage area-slope relation for mountain drainage basins reflects a transition from steep debris flow-dominated channels to lower-gradient alluvial channels.},

	abstract = {Wide, ﬂuvially carved bedrock valleys are found around the world, but little is known about the processes and mechanisms controlling their formation. We know that rates of valley widening are controlled by stream discharge and bedrock lithology, with larger streams and softer rocks resulting in wider valleys. But lithology also controls widening mechanisms that cause valleys with contrasting bedrock strength to widen in fundamentally different ways. The effect of distinct widening mechanisms on bedrock valley width remains unquantiﬁed. We analyze a new topographic data set from various lithologies that demonstrates that bedrock valleys in soft lithologies widen downstream twice as fast as valleys in intermediate lithologies. These downstream valley‐widening rates also emerge from landscape evolution model simulations using two end‐member valley‐widening mechanisms. The topographic data show that lithology and mechanism of valley widening are linked and that different widening mechanisms can control bedrock valley development along river courses. Plain Language Summary Bedrock rivers erode horizontally to create wide bedrock valleys, and wider valleys are created by bigger rivers and in softer rocks. Bedrock valleys made of soft rock widen through a different process than valleys in hard rock, but so far there has been little research on how these distinct processes impact the development of a bedrock valley along a river course. In this study, we collect valley width, drainage area, and wall height data from bedrock valleys with varying rock types and examine the results of a numerical model that simulates two distinct valley‐widening mechanisms. We found that bedrock valleys in soft and hard rock widen at different rates going downstream, which is not part of the current paradigm of bedrock valley widening. We also found that this difference in downstream widening rate is linked to the different widening mechanisms in hard and soft rocks. This is important because it suggests that valley width formation is not as simple as we previously thought and that along with amount of water and bedrock strength, the valley‐widening mechanism is an important factor in understanding bedrock valley widening.},

	abstract = {Bed load sediment particles supplied to channels by hillslopes are reduced in size by abrasion during downstream transport. The branching structure of the channel network creates a distribution of downstream travel distances to a given reach of river and thus may strongly influence the grain size distribution of the long-term bed load flux through that reach. Here we investigate this hypothesis, using mass conservation and the Sternberg exponential decay equation for particle abrasion, to predict bed material variability at multiple scales for both natural and artificial drainage networks. We assume that over a sufficiently long timescale, no net deposition occurs and that grains less than 2 mm are swept away in suspension. We find that abrasion during fluvial transport has a surprisingly small effect on the bed load sediment grain size distribution, for the simple case of spatially uniform supply of poorly sorted hillslope sediments. This occurs because at any point in the channel network, local resupply offsets the size reduction of material transported from upstream. Thus river bed material may essentially mirror the coarse component of the size distribution of hillslope sediment supply. Furthermore, there is a predictable distance downstream at which the bed load grain size distribution reaches a steady state. In the absence of net deposition due to selective transport, large-scale variability in bed material, such as downstream fining, must then be due primarily to spatial gradients in hillslope sediment production and transport characteristics. A second key finding is that average bed load flux will tend to stabilize at a constant value, independent of upstream drainage area, once the rate of silt production by bed load abrasion per unit travel distance is equal to the rate of coarse sediment supply per unit channel length (q). Bed load flux equilibrates over a distance that scales with the inverse of the fining coefficient in the abrasion rate law (α) and can be approximated simply as q/3α. Thus the efficiency of particle abrasion sets a fundamental length scale, shorter for weaker rocks and longer for harder rocks, which controls the expression in the river bed of variability in sediment supply. We explore the role of the abrasion length scale in modulating the influence of sediment supply variability in a number of channel network contexts, including individual tributary junctions, a sequence of tributary inputs along a main stem channel, and variable basin shapes and network architecture as expressed by the width function. These findings highlight the need for both data and theory that can be used to predict the grain size distributions supplied to channels by hillslopes.},
