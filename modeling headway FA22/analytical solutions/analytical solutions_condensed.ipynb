    "This solution works well when rock is more erodible (higher $K$), but diverges as rock becomes harder (lower $K$). One explanation for this is that as rock becomes harder, the model should become more detachment-limited. However, the way to force detachment-limited behavior in the full version of our model is to make attrition ($\\beta$) high, so that sediment doesn't persist in the system. Since there is no $\\beta$ in this scenario, we aren't able to capture that fully detachment-limited behavior that low bedrock erodibility would tend to imply."
